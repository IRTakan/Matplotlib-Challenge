# Matplotlib-Challenge

The Matplotlib challenge involves analyzing data of a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications.
With access provided to the the complete data from their most recent animal study of 249 mice who were identified with SCC 
tumors, I was able study the information and form some observations. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of 
Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. Over a 45 day period, tumor development was observed and 
measured. 

I then had to perfom these tasks:

Prepare the data.

Generate summary statistics.

Create bar charts and pie charts.

Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.

Create a line plot and a scatter plot.

Calculate correlation and regression.

Submit my final analysis.

*Technologies used: Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

*How to activate code: The file for the  dataset sits in the 'Pymaceuticals' folder with the excel datasheets in "data".
 You can open this files in your preferred Python IDEs and run the script.
